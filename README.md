AC3D reader for iPhone

This project contain a reader and renderer for AC3D files for iOS. 

The reader and renderer is contained in the ac3d_reader.m file and it uses
a few supporting functions for texture handling.

There are a couple of demo project to show the features of the reader and renderer.

Please read the licenses.txt file for its usage and any usage of the supplied ac3d models.

Have fun!
